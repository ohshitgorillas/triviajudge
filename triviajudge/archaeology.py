"""Gate: comments state live constraints, not decision archaeology.

A comment earns its keep by telling the next reader a constraint the code
cannot show. A comment that narrates what the code once did, when a decision
happened, or which iteration came before spends the reader's attention on
facts that help nobody make the next change — and each one invites the next.
This gate blocks the phrasing that reliably marks such narration:

- ISO dates in prose (``2026-07-28``) — a dated remark describes a moment,
  not an invariant;
- ``used to``, ``earlier draft/version/design`` and ``as it always was`` —
  past-behavior narration;
- ``extracted``/``split``/``moved``/``pulled``/``lifted``/``carved`` followed by
  ``of`` or ``from``, and ``reorg`` — refactor archaeology. Both prepositions,
  because a rule bound to one of them is a rule you clear by writing the other;
- ``this/that/which replaced`` — replacement narration;
- a past-tense verb sharing a sentence with a literal length (``the bar was
  45.5px``, ``put 48px between two packs``) — measurement archaeology, a number
  describing a layout that is gone. A live measurement is present tense and
  passes;
- conventional-commit citations (``fix(live): …``) — git already holds these;
- ``withdrawn`` / ``was reversed`` / ``process note`` — process archaeology.

What no pattern can catch is narration carrying neither a keyword nor a number
("the bar shipped four heights at once"). The list narrows the failure modes; it
does not decide the question for you.

Scope is shipped code and tooling comments. ``tests/`` is deliberately out of
scope — a regression test legitimately names the bug it pins, in whatever tense
the bug demands — and so is ``scripts/probes/``, whose scripts are session
records with dates as their content. ``CHANGELOG.md`` and vendored code are
excluded by the file list in the Makefile.

The fix is never to reword around the pattern: state the constraint that holds
NOW, in present tense, or delete the remark. History that must stay — an
upstream attribution, a pinned legacy behavior — takes ``history-ok:
<reason>`` on the offending line, reason required, same contract as the token,
class, card and dirty-mark gates.
