"""Gate: no function nests blocks deeper than four levels.

xenon and ruff ``C901`` both measure cyclomatic complexity, which counts
branches and not indentation. A long function that is deeply nested but
branch-cheap scores fine under both and is still unreadable: every line in it
carries four or five conditions the reader has to hold at once.

A level is an ``if``, ``for``, ``while``, ``with``, ``try`` or ``match``, in
their async forms too. Two shapes deliberately do not add one. ``elif`` shares
its ``if``'s level, because a chain of arms is flat to a reader however many
there are — a plain ``else:`` containing an ``if`` is a real level, and is
counted. A nested ``def`` starts its own count rather than inheriting its
enclosing function's, because the reader of the inner function does not carry
the outer one's conditions; it is reported under its dotted name.

Sites that are allowed to stand say why in ``EXEMPT``, keyed
``path::qualified.name``. The mapping is audited against the filesystem rather
than against the paths handed over, so a partial commit that touches one file
is not told every other entry is stale, and an entry that has stopped being
true cannot hide by staying out of the run.

Usage: ``python scripts/gates/check_nesting.py <path>...``
