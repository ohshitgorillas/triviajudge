"""Gate: every gate script in ``scripts/gates/`` runs in the Makefile and in pre-commit.

Each gate is wired in by hand, one line per script, and nothing else notices
when a script never acquires that line — or keeps it after a target is
rewritten. An uninvoked gate stops running, and a gate that stops running rots
silently: it can drift all the way to crashing on import while ``make check``
stays green.

There are two wirings, not one. ``make check`` is run by hand; pre-commit runs
on every commit. A gate present in the first and absent from the second still
looks wired, and the two have drifted apart before. Absence from pre-commit can
be correct — a gate too slow for the commit path belongs in ``make check``
only — but nothing distinguished a deliberate absence from a forgotten one,
because both are spelled as silence.

So Makefile wiring is mandatory with no exemption: a gate that should not run
is a gate that should be deleted. Pre-commit wiring is mandatory *or* exempt,
and an exemption is a line of prose in ``PRECOMMIT_EXEMPT`` saying why. An
exemption naming no gate is itself a failure — a stale reason is the same drift
one layer up. This file polices itself: its own filename in both configs is
what satisfies its own rule.

Usage: ``python scripts/gates/check_gates_wired.py``
