"""Gate: entries under ``[Unreleased]`` are short, impersonal, and shaped alike.

The changelog is written by whoever made the change, which in this repo is
usually an agent that has just spent an hour inside the fix and wants to say all
of it. Left alone that produces ten-line entries carrying flag names, file paths
and the order a gate does things in — the fix's autobiography, not the release
note a reader hitting the bug needs. It also produces a second ``### Added``
heading under the same version, and prose that addresses the reader ("your
pyproject table") in a document nobody reads a sentence of.

None of that survives review, so it costs a review round every time. This gate
spends the round at write time instead.

What it enforces, on ``[Unreleased]`` only — released sections are history and
are never rewritten:

* one bullet is one logical line, at most ``WORD_CAP`` words
* a bullet opens with a bold lead: what it does now, in a clause
* no second person
* no marketing register (``HYPE``)
* no narration by negation (``NEGATION``)
* one heading per kind, in Keep a Changelog order

What it cannot enforce is tone. ``reads as advice`` passes every rule here and
is still marketing. The cap and the wordlist take the bulk off; the residue is a
human's call, and always was.

Usage: ``python scripts/gates/check_changelog.py [CHANGELOG.md]``
