"""Gate: no single source file falls below the coverage floor.

Reads the JSON report ``make test`` writes and refuses any file under the
floor. Exemptions are per file, each with a reason; an exemption naming no
file in the report fails too.

A missing or empty report fails rather than passing. Pre-commit sets no
``fail_fast``, so this still runs when the suite dies, and a tree that was
never measured must not read as a tree that measured clean.

Usage: ``python scripts/gates/check_coverage_floor.py [report] [floor]``
