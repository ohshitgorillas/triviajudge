"""Gate: no source file longer than its limit, and no watched source file longer than last time.

Two rules share this gate because both are read off the same number.

The cap refuses a file outright — 500 lines, 800 under tests/. Test suites get
headroom because the one-assertion-per-test policy inflates line count without
adding coupling; a flat list of cases has no missing abstraction for a split to
surface.

The ratchet is what stops the crawl. A cap on its own makes passing a local
condition: at 501 lines the cheapest move is always to delete two lines, never
to split, so a file parks against the cap and every agent that touches it pays
the same toll again. Above WATCH_LINE a source file must carry an ALLOWANCE
entry and may only ever shrink. Growing past the entry fails; measuring *under*
the entry also fails, until the entry is lowered to match, so headroom cannot be
banked in one commit and spent in the next. The only way out of the watched band
is down.

Nothing here raises an allowance. A file that needs more room needs a split.

The ratchet does not reach under tests/, for the same reason the cap is looser
there.

Allowances are judged against the filesystem rather than against the paths on
argv: pre-commit hands this gate only the files being committed, so an
argv-based staleness rule would call every untouched entry stale on every
partial commit.
