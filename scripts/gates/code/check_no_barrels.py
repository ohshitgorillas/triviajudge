"""Gate: a split moves code, it does not leave a shell behind pointing at where the code went.

Two shapes, both of which make a file shorter without making the tree simpler,
and both of which read as a completed split to anything that only counts lines.

**Re-export module.** A file of imports and nothing else. Every caller keeps its
old import path, nothing was decoupled, and the module exists to be a name.
``__init__.py`` is skipped outright: re-exporting a package's surface is what it
is for, and the shape only lies in a file pretending to be a module of its own.
A module that defines constants defines something, so it is not this — only
``__all__`` is discounted, being the re-export's own manifest.

**Trivial forwarder.** ``def f(self, x): return self._other.f(x)``. The method
moved; the call sites did not. The surface of the class is unchanged, so no
caller was touched, so nothing was actually split — and the next agent to open
the file finds the same method count it had before.

The tell both share is that a caller-visible change did not happen. That is not
directly checkable, so this checks the two syntactic shapes it comes in.

A forwarder that has earned its place — reaching a collaborator that callers
have no other route to is a real job — goes in FORWARDER_EXEMPT with a reason a
human can weigh. A module that legitimately defines nothing goes in
MODULE_EXEMPT the same way. Both lists are audited against the filesystem rather
than against the paths on argv, because pre-commit hands this gate only the
files being committed and an argv-based audit would call every untouched
exemption stale on every partial commit. An entry excusing nothing fails, so an
exemption cannot outlive the thing it excused.

Two shapes rule 2 knowingly does not catch, because widening it to reach them
cost more false positives than the hits were worth: a forwarder that passes an
argument by keyword (``self.other.f(data, scope=scope)``), and one whose chain
is rooted in a call rather than a name (``self.require_http().restore(...)``).
Those are left to review. A gate that
implied it caught every barrel would be worse than one that says where it stops.
